# Task 2
> Run a regression to find the effect of chatbot on sales

```{R}
lm_amt <- lm(purchase_amount ~ chatbot, abtest)
summary(lm_amt)
```

There appears to be a negative correlation between chatbot and sales.

# Task 3
> Find subgroup-specific effects by including an interaction. Compute a CATE for one exemplary group. A subgroup could be for example mobile users.

```{R}
lm_cate <- lm(purchase_amount ~ chatbot * previous_visit + chatbot * mobile_device, abtest)
summary(lm_cate)
```

# Task 4
> Itâ€™s not only of interest how much customers buy but also if the buy at all. Then, the dependent variable is binary (either 0 or 1) instead of continuous and the model of choice is the logistic regression. Use the outcome variable purchase and run a logistic regression. The coefficients are not as easily interpretable as before. Look it up and interpret the coefficient for chatbot.

```{R}
library(stats)
lm_boolean <- glm(purchase ~ chatbot * previous_visit + chatbot * mobile_device, family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = abtest)
summary(lm_boolean)

coef_df <- as.data.frame(coef(summary(lm_boolean)))

# Extracting coefficients and confidence intervals
coef_df <- coef_df %>%
  mutate(term = rownames(coef_df),
         Estimate = Estimate,
         CI_low = Estimate - 1.96 * `Std. Error`,
         CI_high = Estimate + 1.96 * `Std. Error`)
