The correlation coefficient is `0.83`, which indicates a strong positive correlation.\n\nHowever, there is no actual causal relationship between the two. The real reason for the correlation is that both cheese consumption and the number of Nobel Prize winners are influenced by affluence. Affluent countries are more likely to eat cheese and produce Nobel Prize winners.",
